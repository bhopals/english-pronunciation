### M Sound

- To make the M Sound, you are gonna close your lips, and you are gonna breath air in your Nose, and you are not gonna let the air out of your mouth. You are gonna turn the your voice on (vibrate throat), and the air is gonna come out from you nose.

- The M sound sounds kind of like humming mmmm.
- When you eat something yummy, you say mmmmmm
